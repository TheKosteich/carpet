When we have initial access, we can try use token impersonation to gain system
access.

Windows uses tokens to ensure that accounts have the right privileges to carry
out particular actions. Account tokens are assigned to an account when users
log in or are authenticated. This is usually done by LSASS.exe(think of this
as an authentication process).

This access token consists of:
    user SIDs(security identifier)
    group SIDs
    privileges

amongst other things.
More detailed information can be found here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens

There are two types of access tokens:
    primary access tokens: those associated with a user account that are
        generated on log on
    impersonation tokens: these allow a particular process(or thread in a
        process) to gain access to resources using the token of another
        (user/client) process

For an impersonation token, there are different levels:
    SecurityAnonymous: current user/client cannot impersonate another
        user/client
    SecurityIdentification: current user/client can get the identity and
        privileges of a client, but cannot impersonate the client
    SecurityImpersonation: current user/client can impersonate the client's
        security context on the local system
    SecurityDelegation: current user/client can impersonate the client's
        security context on a remote system

where the security context is a data structure that contains users' relevant
security information.

The privileges of an account(which are either given to the account when created
or inherited from a group) allow a user to carry out particular actions. Here
are the most commonly abused privileges:
    SeImpersonatePrivilege
    SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege
    SeTcbPrivilege
    SeBackupPrivilege
    SeRestorePrivilege
    SeCreateTokenPrivilege
    SeLoadDriverPrivilege
    SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
    SeDebugPrivilege

View all the privileges using "whoami /priv". If you can see that two
privileges(SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege) are enabled. Use the
Metasploit incognito module (in meterpreter session) that will allow us to
exploit this vulnerability. To load the incognito module in metasploit enter:
    msf6 > load incognito

To check which tokens are available, enter the
    msf6 > list_tokens -g

If we can see that the "BUILTIN\Administrators" token is available, we cat
use the command to impersonate the Administrators token
    msf6 > impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"
